# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Error: Inaccurate Counts
This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines that can lead to inaccurate results. The original code has a missing stage in the aggregation pipeline. This error leads to incorrect grouping and counting, resulting in inaccurate data.

The solution provided addresses this issue by adding the missing `$project` stage to ensure only specific fields are included in the final results. This helps in getting accurate and efficient results from the aggregation pipeline.

## Bug
The provided `bug.js` file contains the incorrect aggregation pipeline, which causes inaccurate counts. This is due to a missing crucial stage that is responsible for filtering the fields that go to the grouping stage.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the corrected aggregation pipeline. The solution adds a `$project` stage to address the issue and produces the correct counts and results.
